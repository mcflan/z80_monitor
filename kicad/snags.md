# Snag list for PCB

LEDs should be 0805 footprint. Having said that, the 0805 LEDs do seem to fit
reasonably well. We could just order 0603 LEDs instead?

Probably could have done something more useful with CLK pin than just leaving
unconnected, .e.g connect to a timer input so we could measure clock speed?

Consider adding Neopixel for target status (e.g. HALT, etc.?)

Consider changing bus connector to right-angle PCB-mount socket, for direct
connection to target (or via male-female IDC ribbon cable.)
