# Z80 Mk II

This directory contains things relating to my Z80 MkII computer.

  - schematic - reverse-engineered schematics of the computer (kicad format.) 
  - mechanical - drawings and g-code for new brackets, etc. to finally make a
    nice case (or at least some decent mounting feet) for the computer which
    for 30 years has been a set of three bare boards which sort of flap around.
