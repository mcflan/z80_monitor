# Z80 Mk II Source Code

This directory contains source code for the Z80 MkII board. Some files are
edited disassemblies of the original source code, miraculously rescued from
some very old BBC micro floppy disks.

The state of the project when I left it in 1991 and moved on to the MkIII
(flight computer for the Aspire 1 rocket) was that I'd written enough code to
test the main peripherals - keyboard, screen, UART - and so to test all the
hardware. I never got as far as producing any applications.
